# CONFIGURE AND INSTALL THE DJANGO ADMIN SITE APP
- The Django admin site is built as a Django app
- this means the only thing you need to do to set up the Django admin site is configure/install the app as any other Django app
- The Django admin site requires that you previously configure a database and also install the Django base tables
- By default, the Django admin is enabled on all Django projects
- If you open a Django project's urls.py file, in the urlpatterns variable you'll see the line path('admin/', admin.site.urls)
- This last path definition tells Django to enable the admin site app on the /admin/ url directory
- e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
- Next, if you open the project's settings.py file and go to the INSTALLED_APPS variable
-  Near the top of this variable you'll also see the line django.contrib.admin
   which indicates the Django admin site app is enabled.
