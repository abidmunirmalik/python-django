# DJANGO USER SYSTEM
- django user system is based on django.contrib.auth package that is built-in django framework

# TYPES OF DJANGO USERS
- User : If a user authenticates himself Django recognizes him as a User
- AnonymousUser: if a user just surfs an application without any authentication, Django recognizes him as an AnonymousUser

# USER SUB-TYPES
- superuser: The most powerful user with permissions to create, read, update and delete data in the Django admin
             which includes model records and other users
- staff:     A user marked as staff can access the Django admin But permissions to create, read, update and delete 
             data in the Django admin must be given explicitly to a user 
             By default, a superuser is marked as staff.
- active:    All users are marked as active if they're in good standing 
             Users marked as inactive aren't able to authenticate themselves
